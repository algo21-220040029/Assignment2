# Assignment2
In this assignment, i recurrent the research papar 《Volatility and turnover rate construct bull and bear indicators 》 of Huatai Securities。  
The reason I chose this article to reproduce is that in the stock market, judging the type of market is especially important.   
Different types of factors have huge differences in performance in different market styles.   
For example, in a bull market, the entire market is pulling up, and each stock rotates upwards, and the effects of reversal factors and momentum factors will be better;  
while in a bear market, the effects of reversal factors will be unsatisfactory ,and at the meantime, stocks with high dividends and low volatility may have good defensive  
functions. 
And of course, this is not absolute.
